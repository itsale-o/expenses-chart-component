## Overview

This is my solution to the expenses chart challenge. It was built entirely width HTML, CSS and JavaScript. And an extern JSON file was used to dynamically edit some elements.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current day’s bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device’s screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Use the JSON data file provided to dynamically size the bars on the chart
